Indian Market Focus

This project is strictly built for the Indian stock market:
NSE & BSE listed companies only
Prices, ratios, and valuations in INR (₹)
Indian accounting and reporting standards
Promoter, FII, and DII holding considerations
Indian sector and regulatory risk awareness
⏱️ Real-Time Data Handling (Important)

📈 Stock Prices
Prices are fetched from near real-time market data sources
Each price is displayed with a timestamp
The Last Traded Price (LTP) is captured at the moment of analysis and used consistently across:
Dashboard
AI reasoning

PDF report
⚠️ Note: Exact tick-by-tick NSE/BSE prices require licensed broker APIs.
This system uses the latest available market snapshot, which is the industry-standard approach for retail investment platforms.

📊 Fundamental Data
Financial KPIs (ROE, P/E, Debt-Equity, etc.) are derived from:
Latest published financial statements
Consistent formula-based calculations
Fundamentals are not real-time by nature and are clearly labeled with their reporting period.
This approach prioritizes consistency, transparency, and trust.

📊 Analysis Components
Fundamental Analysis
Profitability (ROE, ROCE)
Growth trends
Debt and balance-sheet strength
Valuation metrics
Long-term business quality

🤖 AI Reasoning Layer

The AI component (Google Gemini) acts as a financial analyst, not a calculator.
It:
Interprets structured metrics
Explains investment logic
Assesses risk and suitability
Generates investor-friendly insights

It does not:
Predict stock prices
Give trading calls
Guarantee returns
